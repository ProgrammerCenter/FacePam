# FacePam
Linux face recognition PAM module

To build it, you need to install seeta face6. You can get this from [thier offical Github Repository](https://github.com/seetafaceengine/SeetaFace6/), or ask me for a built archlinux package. You also need to get the models. 
You also need opencv.

## TODO
- Make the program more configurable.
- Complete the Makefile.
- Make a sddm theme for it.
- Rebuild it with DBus. I'll release v2.0.0 for it.
